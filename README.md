FlashCard
=========

Open-source Website for [FlashCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard).

The website helps language students to improve their vocabulary. Students create
their own dictionary online. The vocabulary is available as
[FlashCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard). Using the vocabulary
created, the user can take quizzes on it.

The source code is open source, and available on the
[github](https://github.com/aRkadeFR/FlashCard) platform. Open Source
means that if you require a feature or you're experiencing a bug, you can
browse the code and contribute to the project.

The main instance hosted online is available [here](https://izidict.com/). You
can also, if you're a bit techie, host your instance yourself. I can provide you
some script to deploy your instance. I'm personally using
[posixcube](https://github.com/myplaceonline/posixcube),
[debian package](https://www.debian.org/) and
[sqitch](https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch) to automate my deployment.

This is also my laboratory to experiment with new technologies. This project has been
done with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/),
[Servant](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant),
[YeshQL](https://github.com/tdammers/yeshql),
[PostgreSQL (10+)](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the backend,
 and [ELM 0.19](https://elm-lang.org/) for the frontend.

I hope this project will give some light around these great technologies,
helping newcomers to find out how to use them.
